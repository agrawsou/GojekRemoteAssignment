Tools Used

1. Automation tool : Selenium
2. Tech Stack Used : BDD/Cucumber

The following implementations have been done in the code:

1. I have used maven as a dependency resolver.
2. I have implemented reporting through extent report.
3. I have used Page Object Model as the design pattern.

Code Walkthrough:

1. Dependencies have been added and resolved through pom.xml file.
2. Created a config.properties file in order to host the environment variables.
3. Created a TestBase.java class in order to load the property file which hosts a initialization method to launch the browser and URL. This class acts as the parent of all other classes.
4. Created separate page layer for each page in the application which consists of the WebElements/WebObjects and actions performed on them in the form of methods.
5. The scenarios have been written in gherkin syntax in the feature file.
6. The mapping of the scenarios have been done in step definition files. Separate step definition file exists for separate pages. Assertions have been written in step definition files.
7. A runner class has been created to run the project consisting of various plugins including extent report.
8. A TestUtils.java class have been created in order to host the important utilities like explicit waits, selecting values from dropdown etc.
9. Test credentials to the amazon site can be found in config.properties file
